					<p class="text">Finding Work and the Time to Reap the Rewards of a Freelance Lifestyle</p>
					<span class="extend"><p>With a limited amount of time in the day and so many roles to fill — not to mention doing the work you originally set out to do, as a freelancer, you need to make the most of your time. To treat marketing, learning, and personal projects as three separate entities probably won’t leave you with much time to make a success of any. My approach is to combine the three.</p>
					<p>When I first started freelancing, I got print adverts placed in telephone directories and a local brochure, printed business cards, and did a small amount of networking. Admittedly, I only tried traditional marketing in perhaps the first six months of freelancing but it just didn’t get me very far.</p>
					<p>Whilst hoping for that marketing to kick-in, I started work on better learning front end development. I’ve always found the best way to learn is to do, so I created little personal projects to help me learn.
					As I was dubious about the traditional marketing I had done up to this point, I started blogging about my personal projects and made the code available for free. Although I didn’t immediately get work from this, I could see my exposure was increasing on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>
					<p>Aside from my “Going Freelance” series of blog posts, I had written seven or eight tutorials to go along with my personal projects. Then I wrote Nikebetterworld Parallax Effect Demo, which exploded in popularity (and is still my most popular blog post at the time of writing).</p>
					<p>In writing Nikebetterworld Parallax Effect Demo I had the opportunity to learn, create something fun, and increase my online exposure significantly. Aside from the time — which was well spent anyway, it didn’t cost me a thing and I probably got project requests relating to that blog post for about 18 months, solid enough to have seen me do nothing but those types of projects right the way through if I had wanted.</p>
					<p>I killed three birds with one stone; marketing, learning and creating personal projects. It became apparent that traditional marketing wasn’t required.</p></span>

					<p class="text">Gulp: First Impressions</p>
					<span class="extend"><p>Grunt has long been my command line companion of choice. It has served me well. I have no complaints but I’ve read many obituaries so this week I sat down to test Gulp, its supposed successor. These are my first impressions.</p>
					Gulp is a build system that runs on Node like Grunt. <p>While Grunt is an all-purpose task runner, Gulp is based around streaming — sending files through filters / pipes to do things like preprocessing, minification, and concatenation.</p><p>I found gulp easy to configure. It took me several hours to convert my entire Grunt build script. This included converting several of my own tasks to stream-based gulp plugins. (I need to brush-up on my understanding of Node streams.) Running a full build was noticeably faster than its Grunt predecessor, despite the likely poor optimisation and metaphorical duct tape.</p>
					<p>In my case I’m not sure gulp reaches its full speed potential. I have a lot of bottlenecks: Sass can’t compile CSS without PNG / SVG for inline data URIs — images aren’t ready until compressed — some fallback images don’t exist until they’re generated from SVG sources — SVGs are first minimised.</p>
					<p>This dependency chain results in a very linear build defeating the main benefit of gulp. My tasks for JavaScript and HTML preprocessing can run concurrently but these were almost instant in Grunt anyway. What I need to do is better configure multiple tasks for half-builds so I can skip bottlenecks, i.e. image related tasks that I don’t need to be repeating regularly.</p>
					<p>I can definitely see a place for gulp but it won’t be taking over my Grunt set-up right now. My requirements just aren’t very big or demanding. I’d be replacing like for like.</p>
					<p>Still, gulp gets my thumbs-up for whatever that’s worth. I’ll look at in again in the future if it doesn’t get usurped tomorrow (apparently Broccoli is the new hotness).</p></span>

					<p class="text">Responsive Design for Houden</p>
					<span class="extend"><p>My first task was to update the header / navigation, and design a responsive hero unit. This would need to support multiple layouts. I decided on a new approach for me, using CodePen as a tool for live, in-browser designing.</p>
					<p>The client provided access to their code repository, along with an automated workflow to push CSS and Liquid template changes to the development server.</p>
					<p>Even with an automated process there is some friction uploading to a remote environment. By using CodePen I could eliminate this delay while still allowing my client to see immediate progress. I was able to design rapidly, and once happy with the direction, it was a simple task of copying the code back into the templates.</p>
					<p>One simple but immensely useful feature of CodePen is the ability to fork (duplicate) pens and continue editing. This allowed me to play around with different concepts while leaving behind a nice design history. This isn’t so easy when working with local files — occasionally I’ll branch of in Git and tag key milestones, but often I won’t bother if I’m “in the zone” designing.</p>
					<p>Like any tool, CodePen isn’t going to design or code for you, but like a good night’s sleep or a strong cup of coffee, I found the experience very conducive to good work.</p></span>

					<p class="text">Order: HTML vs CSS</p>
					<span class="extend"><p>Content should follow a logical top-to-bottom order within HTML. CSS is used to change the visual presentation of this content across different viewports.</p>
					<p>On small viewports — mobile phones for example — a vertical layout that mimics the HTML order is generally a safe default. For wider viewports it is common to introduce more complex layout that flows LTR (left to right) and TTB (top to bottom).</p>
					<p><em>What happens when HTML source order differs from CSS presentation order?</em></p>
					<p>Below I’m going to tackle the technical aspect of this question.</p>
					<h3>CSS Layout</h3>
					<p>CSS layout is not entirely independent of HTML source order. As a rule of thumb CSS follows the language’s natural flow (LTR / TTB). This can be hard to break.</p>
					<p>By far the cleanest way to change presentation order I’ve seen is to use Flexbox. It has a built in order property. See my CodePen (embedded below) for an example that uses multiple fallback techniques to achieve the same results without Flexbox.</p>
					<p>This demo introduces a three column layout on viewports 640px and wider.</p>
					<p>In the first example I’m using basic floats to create a grid. I’m then progressively enhancing to override with Flexbox and change the presentation order. You can toggle Flexbox support on/off to see the default order.</p>
					<p>In the second example I’m using two very different techniques to achieve the same layout without Flexbox. This requires negative margins for the horizontal layout, and rarely used table display values for the vertical layout. The CSS is complicated and unintuitive but it works in IE9.</p>
					<p>As you can see life is much easier with Flexbox!</p>
					<p>There are other ways to change presentation order. For a basic two column layout you can simply float the first column right and the second column left. You could also consider position: absolute if an element has known dimensions, using padding or margins on siblings or the parent to make space.</p></span>

					<p class="text">Work as a Freelancer</p>
					<span class="extend"><p>It’s been over a year since I started freelancing and time has flown by in the most enjoyable of fashions. Work has been good and financially I hit my 12 month target — nothing specific or special; enough to get by. I didn’t expect to match my London salary nor have I but all balanced out I’m doing well enough.</p>
					<p>Client work has been steady and I have a couple of stand out portfolio pieces ready to show for my efforts: King’s Transfer and Uwe Wittwer. I’ve also had plenty of time for self-initiated projects: dbushell.com and Tales. For the most part front-end development has been my bread and butter. I’d like to have blogged more frequently but I’d rather wait for inspiration to strike than to force a schedule.</p>
					<p>To-date most of my work has come from enquiries. That is to say, I haven’t gone looking directly for jobs. I feel that needs to change. I need to be more proactive.</p>
					<p><h3>Thinking Proactively</h3></p>
					<p>To survive on enquiries alone sounds like a wonderful position. Some may call this lucky but I believe it’s down to hard work. I’ve built up a reputable online presence blogging and otherwise contributing to the industry. I credit these efforts in large to why I was hired full-time in the past.</p>
					<p>My conference talk last year at Responsive Day Out happened to coincide with the start of my new career path and undoubtedly had a big impact on the months following.</p>
					<p>The problem is I haven’t attended a conference since Brighton — only a handful of small meet-ups. To be honest, I find it difficult to justify the ticket and travel costs for the big conferences. I don’t believe I’m personally going to take away enough value. That’s no disrespect to speakers, I just feel I can stay sharp making use of other resources.</p>
					<p>I am hugely appreciative of the opportunities I’ve had to talk on stage, I’m just not sure it’s for me… but maybe I can / should be persuaded more often? Regardless, I need to value opportunities to “network” more. To get to know fellow freelancers and agencies. It’s hard to quantify the value of networking but I’m sure I’m missing out on something. If I’m not getting out there how will I ever know?</p></span>
